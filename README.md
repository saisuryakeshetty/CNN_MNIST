# CNN_MNIST
MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “Hello World” dataset of computer vision.
MNIST is a widely used dataset of handwritten digits that contains thousands of handwritten digits for training and testing a machine learning model.

In this mini project, we will build a Sequencial Convolutional Neural Network with keras API that correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.
